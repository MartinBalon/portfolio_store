        review: `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog doesn't mind as he's
        fast asleep. Should he wake up during foxes jump he would most definitely caught it midair
        and told it off. Well, that is a lie actually - the dog is lazy and that is why he sleeps all 
        day. Nothing bothers him - not even our cunning little fox.`

        review: `Uggh "Czechia?" You know we don't like our country to be called that way. If 
        I wasn't so lazy I would've changed the name ages ago. And what are all these footprints
        around me? It looks like they all belong to a big overweight rodent. What, fox you say?
        Are you taking a mickey?! I would've known if there was a fox around. There are no foxes here for
        they are all scared of me! All this talk makes me tired. I'm going to take a short nap.
        Bye humans.`
